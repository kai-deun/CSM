# GAUSS-JORDAN ELIMINATION PROJECT (Square matrix solver)

**_Progress:_** ![Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/45)

An application to solve matrices through **Gauss-Jordan**
Elimination Method of a Linear Equation with the integration
of _Python_ programming language and importing a package called
_NumPy_ for proper computing and _PyInstaller_ for compiling the application.
and by using an algorithm in solving the problem.
<br></br>
The project is currently under development, and it comes in
two application project, a **Python** and a **Java** version.
<br></br>
**Current Assumptions:**

* The algorithm can solve any sizes of **square matrix**
* Only supports static algorithm for solving the problem

## WHAT IS GAUSS-JORDAN ELIMINATION

* Gauss-Jordan Elimination is a method of eliminating
the unknown from all other equations rather than the
subsequent ones.
<br></br>
And all rows are normalized by dividing them by their
pivot elements resulting into an identity matrix
rather than a triangular matrix.
<br></br>
Consequently,  it is not needed to do back substitution
to get the solution.

## INSTALLATION

* [use PyInstaller for compiling into .exe format]
* [requirements.txt soon for dependencies]

## ALGORITHM

* [refer to mechtutor's code algorithm and step-by-step
  solving method]
* Two-way explanation

## REFERENCES

* Video Guide by _mechtutor com_:
    * [Gauss-Jordan Method Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOLJMKGNivU)
      is a command-line tutorial (no gui) but hardcoded input
