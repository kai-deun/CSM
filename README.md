# GAUSS-JORDAN ELIMINATION PROJECT

**_Progress:_** ![Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/30)

An application to solve matrices through **Gauss-Jordan**
Elimination Method of a Linear Equation with the integration
of _Python_ programming language and importing a package called
_NumPy_ for proper computing.
and by using an algorithm in solving the problem.
<br></br>
The project is currently in development, and it comes in
two application project, a **Python** and a **Java** version.
